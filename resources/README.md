You should store any files and resources that used in the creation of this hdocbook, but do not form part of the published content.

These files are included in the build and final content output but we should keep in the source code repo for future revisions.  For example, if you were to create an image used in the content, say, in Photoshop, you will create the image and put that into the appropriate content location.  However, you may also want to put the Photoshop source file into this **resources** folder in order to keep for the future, should anyone need to modify the image, we have the original source file.

Another new line.
